  -Raise_Carry_Capacity
  
  -This sets the carry capacity of the player to be double of what the vanilla game would normally be. 
   This allows the user to be able to carry more at one time, eliminating some frustration with 
   loosing out on money and loot when carry capacity is reached looting during a mission
